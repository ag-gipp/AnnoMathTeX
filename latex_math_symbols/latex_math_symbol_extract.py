"""
Have to extract the parts of math environment. 
Is it necessary to recognize what parts there are?
    - yes, for identifier recognition
    - maybe, for formula recognition
        - if several formulae are in the same math environment (on the same line)
        
        
Useful: 
    - Source code to 'the not so short introduction to latex': https://github.com/oetiker/lshort
    - List of latex mathematical symbols (incomplete): https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols
    
BETTER: Construct rules, by which the strings are split into their parts
