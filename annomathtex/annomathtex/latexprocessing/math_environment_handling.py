"""
Math environment handling involves the revognition of formulae and identifiers.
These have to be recognised as being individual parts.
Then values from the surrounding text (NLP) should be associated with them,
and/or the corresponding wikidata Qid added.

Wikidata Qid can be extracted using
    - pywikibot
    - sparql

Steps:
    - extract math environment
    - extract identifiers
    - extract formulae
    - access wikidata
    - find Qid
